## Cruddit App

## Background
Here at Northcoders we have been set the task of creating our own version of a popular online site. A page dedicated to different news, articles, topics... whatever you want really.

This repo is the frontend of the app - the result of a previously finished backend api (Add repo link here), knowledge of the React framework, a week to timeframe to complete and a lot of coffee. 

Enjoy.
